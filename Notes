Thank you for the clarification! Your requirements make perfect sense and align well with modern software development practices. Let me break down how we can approach this:

Architecture & Design Principles:
1. Modular Architecture
   - Core module for HUD display
   - Calendar sync module
   - Configuration module
   - Event management module
   - Each module should be independently testable and maintainable

2. Cross-Platform Support
   - Electron.js would be ideal for this as it:
     - Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
     - Provides native system integration
     - Allows for transparent, always-on-top windows
     - Has excellent community support and documentation

3. Cloud-Ready Design
   - Microservices architecture
   - RESTful API for calendar sync
   - Stateless design where possible
   - Secure credential management
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

4. Containerization
   - Docker support for easy deployment
   - Containerized services for different components
   - Environment-agnostic configuration
   - Easy scaling and maintenance

HUD Design Principles:
1. Minimalist Interface
   - Semi-transparent overlay
   - Configurable opacity
   - Customizable position
   - Smart positioning to avoid active work areas
   - Collapsible/expandable view

2. Non-Intrusive Features
   - Configurable display modes
   - Smart hiding when user is active in certain applications
   - Gesture controls for interaction
   - Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions
   - System tray integration

Technical Stack Proposal:
1. Frontend (HUD):
   - Electron.js with React/TypeScript
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Framer Motion for smooth animations
   - Electron Store for local configuration

2. Backend Services:
   - Node.js/TypeScript for API services
   - Express.js for REST API
   - Google Calendar API integration
   - WebSocket for real-time updates

3. Development Tools:
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Jest for testing
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Docker for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

4. Project Structure:
```
time-keeper/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Core HUD functionality
│   ├── calendar/       # Calendar integration
│   ├── config/         # Configuration management
│   ├── events/         # Event handling
│   └── ui/            # UI components
├── services/          # Backend services
├── tests/            # Test suites
├── docker/           # Docker configurations
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

Would you like me to help you:
1. Set up the initial project structure with the proposed architecture?
2. Create a basic HUD prototype to test the concept?
3. Implement the Google Calendar integration?
4. Set up the development environment with all necessary tools?

Let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle first, and I'll help you get started with the implementation!
