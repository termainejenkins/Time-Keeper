### Testing Notes
- Verified dark mode colors in both themes
- Tested task updates with various scenarios
- Confirmed inline editing works as expected
- Validated error handling and feedback
- Verified task updates now appear instant
- Confirmed UI remains visible during updates
- Tested error handling and recovery

- Confirmed task timing calculations are accurate
- Tested edge cases for recurring tasks
- Validated task transitions and updates
- Verified color transitions at custom threshold points
- Confirmed accurate percentage calculations
- Tested time display format switching
- Validated preview animation with new settings

### Next Steps

## [2024-06-10]

### Features Implemented
- Added new repeat options for tasks: Weekdays, Weekends, Every Other Day, and Custom Days.
- Improved the display of repeating tasks in both the HUD and Task List components.
- Repeat days are now shown using abbreviations (e.g., [M-F], [Sa-Su], [Every 2 days]).
- For repeating tasks, the date is no longer shown in the task list.
- Added task editing functionality:
  - Edit button added to each task in the task list
  - TaskForm component updated to handle both creation and editing
  - Support for modifying repeat settings (interval, days) for repeating tasks
  - Cancel button added to edit mode
  - Improved UI for task list items with edit button
- Added the ability to delete tasks from the Task List. Each task now has a Delete button next to the Edit button.

### Technical Details
- Implemented a `handleTaskDeleted` function in the TaskList component.
- The function removes the task from local state immediately for instant UI feedback, then sends a delete request to the main process via IPC.
- If an error occurs, the task list is refreshed to ensure consistency.
- TypeScript error handling was improved by specifying `error: unknown` in all relevant catch blocks.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- The Delete button is styled distinctly (red color scheme) and appears next to the Edit button for each task.
- Deleting a task is instant and does not require a page reload.

### Changes Accepted
- UI improvements for the HUD and Task List as per user feedback.
- All code changes for repeat logic and display have been reviewed and accepted.
- Task editing functionality implementation has been reviewed and accepted.

## [2024-03-22]

### Features Implemented
- Enhanced dynamic border color functionality for tasks
- Implemented gradual color transitions for border changes
- Added preview animation reset functionality when toggled
- Improved options window with more descriptive information about dynamic colors
- Optimized preview animation to run only when actively used:
  - Only runs when HUD tab is selected and preview is enabled
  - Automatically stops when switching tabs or closing window
  - Properly cleans up resources when not in use
  - Maintains smooth 30-second color transition cycle
  - Scales time values to match real-world task durations

### Technical Improvements
- Optimized color calculations for smoother transitions
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improved state management for preview animation
- Enhanced cleanup logic to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented proper component lifecycle management

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Smooth color transitions in preview animation

### Testing Notes
- Verified preview animation starts/stops correctly
- Confirmed color transitions match real-world task durations
- Tested cleanup on window close and tab switch
- Validated memory usage during extended preview sessions

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more color customization options
- Explore additional visual feedback mechanisms
- Monitor performance in extended use cases
